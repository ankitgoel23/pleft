### Getting started with the code ###

Please get involved! Patches are welcome. We plan to keep the running verson at pleft.com up-to-date with the open source code. If youâ€™re not sure what to do, please join our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pleft) and introduce yourself.

[Download the source code at GitHub](https://github.com/sander/pleft) and see the GettingStarted page to get started.

Pleft is open source as of December 22, 2010. It was developed in a private Git repository before. The GettingStarted page might lack detail and there might be other problems when running outside of our infrastructure. If so, please report an issue on this site or send an email to the mailing list.
